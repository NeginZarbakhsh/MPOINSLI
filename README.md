# Mapillary Points of Interest Neighborhood Street-level Imagery: A Potential Dataset for Neighborhood Analytics in Cities

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) identify sustainable urban development as one of the key priorities for making cities more liveable and economically and socially beneficial. Points-of-Interest (POIs) are one of the most important indicators of city development, and a thorough understanding of their neighborhood is required to assess the popularity and accessibility of the POIs. street view imaging has quickly risen to prominence as an indispensable resource for geospatial data collection and urban computing analytics. The current state-of-the-art focuses primarily on city-level analyses of these images, whereas our research concentrates on POI-level neighborhoods. We developed a framework to filter images that contain a portion of POIs building in their fields of view (FOV) to provide the first and most comprehensive POIs-neighborhood street-view imagery of New York City. Using Safegraph data on the locations of POIs and building footprints in conjunction with Mapillary's crowdsourced street-level imagery, we match POI neighborhood images with POIs and investigate their spatial and temporal availability. The collected data contains 875,592 POIs divided into 23 top-categories and 67 sub-categories, with 167,743 of them containing the POIs in their FOV. Images are geo-located using GPS, camera-related parameters, the Harvesian distance between the camera and POIs, the intersection area between camera FOV and POIs polygon, and the top and subcategory to which the POIs belong. The datasets are freely available for academic research, with promising future applications in scene recognition across POIs neighborhoods, urban analytics, health and wellness, and assessing the local quality and reputation of cities.
